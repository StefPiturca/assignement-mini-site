        <P>
            <span>
                Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils,archaically called
       "Pupin coils",followed closely on the pionerring work of the English psycist 
       and mathematicuab Oliver Heaviside,which predates Pupin's patent by 
       some seven years.</span>
    </P>
   <p>The importance of patent was made clear when the Americans 
       rights to it were acquired by American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T),
       making him wealthy.</p>
    <p>Although AT&T bought pupin's patent,they made little use of it, 
        as they already had their own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up 
        to this point being challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
    </p>
    <p>AT&T were afraid they would lose control 
       of an invention which was immensely valuable due to
       its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones
       and especially submarine ones.</p>
