				<hr>
		        <p>Mihajlo Pupin was born on 9 Octomber (27 September,OS)
		        1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of Kovacica,Serbia) in Banat,
		        In the Military frontier in the Austrian Empire.
		        He always remembered the words of his mother
		        cited her in the autobiography,from Immigrant to Inventor (1925):
		    	</P>
		    	<p>"My boy,if you wish to go out in the world about which
		        you hear so much neighborhood gatherings,you must provide yourself with 
		        another pair of eyes;the eyes of reading and writing.
		    There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning in the world 
		       which you cannot get unless you read and write.
		       Knowledge is the golden ladder 
		       over which we climb to heaven;knowledge is the light
		       which illuminates our path through this life 
		       and leads to a future life of everlasting glory."</p>
		   		<p>Pupin went to elementary school in his birthplace 
		       to Serbian Orthodox School,and later to German elementary school in Perlez.</p>
		    He enrolled in high school in Pancevo,and later in the Real Gymnasium.</p>
		      He was one of the best students there;a local 
		       archpriest saw his enormous potential and talent,and
		       influenced the authorities to give Pupin a scholarship.</p>
		    	<p>Because of his main activity in the "Serbian Youth",
		    movement which at that time had many problems with 
		    Austro-Hungarian police authorities,Pupin had to leave Pancevo.</p>
		    <P> In 1872,he went to Prague,where he continued the sixth
		        and first half of the seventh year.</P>
		    <P>After his father died in march 1874,the sixteen year old 
		        Pupin decided to cancel his education in Prague Due
		        to financial problems and to move to the United States.</P>
		    <p>"When I landed at Castle Garden,forty-eight years ago,
		        I had only five Cents in my pocket.
		    Had I brought five hundred dollars,instead of the five cents
		        my immediate carreer in the,new and to me perfectly strange
		        land would have been the same.
		        A young immigrant such as I was then
		            does not begin his career until he has spent
					all the money which he has brought with him.</p>

						<h3>Studies in Ph D. Bull</h3>
					<p>For the next five years in the United States, 
	          		Pupin worked as a manual laborer 
			        (most notably at the biscuit factory on 
			        Cortlandt Street in Manhattan) while he learned 
			        English, Greek and Latin. He also gave private lectures. 
			        After three years of various courses, 
			        in the autumn of 1879 he successfully 
			        finished his tests and entered Columbia College, 
			        where he became known as an exceptional athlete and scholar. 
			        A friend of Pupin's predicted 
			        that his physique would make him a splendid oarsman, 
			        and that Columbia would do anything for a good oarsman. 
			        A popular student, he was elected president of 
			        his class in his Junior year. 
			        He graduated with honors in 1883 
			        and became an American citizen at the same time.</p>
	     			<p>He obtained his Ph.D. at the University of Berlin under Hermann von Helmholtz and in 1889 he returned to Columbia University to become a lecturer of mathematical physics in the newly formed Department of Electrical Engineering. Pupin's research pioneered carrier wave detection and current analysis.
	    			Pupin completed his studies in 1883 as one of the best students, especially in the field of physics and mathematics, which gave him a diploma. Later, he went back to Europe, initially the United Kingdom (1883–1885), where he continued his schooling at the University of Cambridge. He was an early investigator into X-ray imaging, but his claim to have made the first X-ray image in the United States is incorrect. He learned of Röntgen's discovery of unknown rays passing through wood, paper, insulators, and thin metals leaving traces on a photographic plate, and attempted this himself. Using a vacuum tube, which he had previously used to study the passage of electricity through rarefied gases, he made successful images on January 2, 1896. Edison provided Pupin with a calcium tungstate fluoroscopic screen which, when placed in front of the film, shortened the exposure time by twenty times, from one hour to a few minutes. Based on the results of experiments, Pupin concluded that the impact of primary X-rays generated secondary X-rays. With his work in the field of X-rays, Pupin gave a lecture at the New York Academy of Sciences. He was the first person to use a fluorescent screen to enhance X-rays for medical purposes. A New York surgeon, Dr. Bull, sent Pupin a patient to obtain an X-ray image of his left hand prior to an operation to remove lead shot from a shotgun injury. The first attempt at imaging failed because the patient, a well-known lawyer, was "too weak and nervous to be stood still nearly an hour" which is the time it took to get an X-ray photo at the time. In another attempt, the Edison fluorescent screen was placed on a photographic plate and the patient's hand on the screen. X-rays passed through the patients hand and caused the screen to fluoresce, which then exposed the photographic plate. A fairly good image was obtained with an exposure of only a few seconds and showed the shot as if "drawn with pen and ink." 
	 				Bull was able to take out all of the lead balls in a very short time.</p>
